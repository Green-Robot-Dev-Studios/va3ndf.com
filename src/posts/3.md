The University of Waterloo Rocketry team utilizes amateur radio in the form of APRS for telemetry and tracking of the rocket! 

You'd think we went with a good ol' off the shelf APRS transceiver, and you would be partially correct! So far, we've been using an OTS APRS module that has worked great for us! But where's the fun in that? This term, we're designing a brand new one from the ground up. We're considering many possible architectures for this, maybe FPGAs? We'll see. (and you can see too if you subscribe to my RSS feed!)
