# Postal QSL

### A new QSL card management service that I am building!

#### How it works:
1. Export your QSOs from your favorite logging software
1. Upload them here
1. Choose who you want to send QSL cards to
1. The QSL card gets automatically generated based on your template
1. QSL card is sent!

#### Why am I qualified to build this?
- I've worked in software-based postal mail automation professionally, and have connections that will guarantee you get the best price 
- I've built many successful software projects in my spare time
- I'm an amateur radio operator myself (pretty obvious given the site & all)

#### Interested?
This project is still a work in progress, but drop me your email and I'll let you know when it's done! (don't worry, I personally promise to send you an absolute maximum of 3 (three) emails, and I will make sure they are of value to you by including a punny joke!)
