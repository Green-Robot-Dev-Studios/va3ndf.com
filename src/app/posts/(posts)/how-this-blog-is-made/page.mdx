import excali from "./assets/test.excalidraw.json";

Here are a few of my favorite widgets I have implemented for my site

## Desmos!
<Desmos cells={["y=2x"]} />

## Quizes!
<Quiz question="What is the best programming language?" answers={["Brainf", "Piet", "Malboge", "JSf"]} />

## Excalidraw!
<Excalidraw file={excali} />

## Admonitions!
<Admonition type="normal">
    ### Hi from the admonition!
</Admonition>
