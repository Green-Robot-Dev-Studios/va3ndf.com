I made a python script that takes your webcam's pixels, converts them to Minecraft blocks, then passes them to a datapack that places the blocks in your Minecraft's world! Here is an example:

It maps each pixel color in the webcam to a concrete color in Minecraft. It was quite fun to build and a nice weekend project!
