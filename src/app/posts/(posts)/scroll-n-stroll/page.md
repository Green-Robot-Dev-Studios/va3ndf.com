People are spending way too much time on their phones right now all cooped up in their houses. I decided to tackle this problem by building Scroll n Stroll. An app, as the name suggests, where you need to amass steps in order to increase your screen time allowance. The app is not yet published, but I learned a lot while building it. I learned flutter while building it. I had a great experience using flutter. It was a lot of fun and intuitive to be building in.
