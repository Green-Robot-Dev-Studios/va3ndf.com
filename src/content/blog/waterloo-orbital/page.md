### We're building a satellite!
34x10x10, that's what we've got. Not meters, feet, nor inches, but centimeters. It really ain't that much if you want to fit everything. 4kg max too.

### The Canadian Satellite Design Challenge
> Competition for teams of university students to design and build a small science research satellite known as a “cubesat” or “nanosatellite”.

This year, University of Waterloo won! Yay! 

### Why?

We're building a payload that serves amateur radio operators! It's essentially a ham selfie stick! You place a request with some coordinates attached, then the next time our satellite is over that location we will take a photo and send it down over UHF with SSTV.
