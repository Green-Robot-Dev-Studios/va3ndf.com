    <p><em>Pst, hey. You. Yeah you. This is my first blog post. I'll get better as I go, amateur radio seems to be one of those hobbies that grows with you for a long, long, long time.</em></p>
<h3>How long 'till I made a QSO?</h3>
<p>Too long. I had to wait 'till my Baofeng would come from Amazon. Longest next day shipping I've ever had to sit through. I was practicing clicking the PTT button like an air guitar.</p>
<p>Anyway, I finally got the radio, mashed the PTT from my BASEMENT and heard absolutely nothing in return. Oh how naive I was (and still am). I quickly plugged it into my Mac to program it, and ran into about a thousand driver issues, then finally got my channels programmed in. I remember hitting &quot;Program&quot; and then the screen going flush orange, meaning I was transmitting. I had a mini panic attack because I figured I was emitting the programming sounds. (I was, but it's not like I hit a receiver anyway)</p>
<p>Later that night was the weekly OARC (Ottawa Amateur Radio Club) net, so I rushed upstairs to my brother's bedroom, and tried hitting the repeater. Nothing. (that is, nothing but my Roger Beep TM) Unfortunately I was fooled by the &quot;10-20km&quot; range of HTs. I think I actually managed to barely engage the repeater for a split second, but all I did was kerchunk it.</p>
<p>The next week, I was ready. I got my bike, went to the highest mountain I could find, and was read 599 across 3 repeaters. (At this point my basic training kicked in and I instinctively turned down the power of the radio, because &quot;only use the power you need to hit the station!&quot;)</p>
<h3>Part two</h3>
<p>About a month in is where I started to really branch out. I started doing:</p>
<ul>
<li>EchoLink</li>
<li>Building my own 40m CW transceiver</li>
<li>Learning, learning, and more learning</li>
<li>SDRs</li>
<li>Joining my school's amateur adjacent club</li>
</ul>
<p>In the coming time, I will be writing about all of these in much greater depth individually.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading my first blog post!</p>
