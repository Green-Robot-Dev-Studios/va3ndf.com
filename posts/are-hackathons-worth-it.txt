2:T448,Some people will just show up to a hackathon with a blank slate. No team or idea. This is okay! I've done this before and it can be fun, but I've decided that I prefer having a premade team before the hackathon. This doesn't mean I will be with my friends though. Sometimes you can network with fellow hackers before the hackathon. This is a great way to find new people and network! As for ideas, well, this is my one grime with hackathons. Your starting idea is very important if you are looking to win. Not everyone does and that's okay, just have fun. I have never joined a hackathon with one set idea. I usually boil down a list of ideas, or come up with new ideas at the hackathon. Admittedly, this is not a great way to do it. It usually causes me stress during the hackathon and eats up valuable time where I'm rested. Coming up with an idea is surprisingly hard, especially one the judges will like. Another issue with ideas is that specifically during Covid, a lot of teams were making unoriginal projects related to Covid. A surprising amount of teams just won by simply displaying an 0:["VxpT9m2z_1ZNll_lBbTbp",[[["",{"children":["posts",{"children":["(posts)",{"children":["are-hackathons-worth-it",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]}]}]}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],["",{"children":["posts",{"children":["(posts)",{"children":["are-hackathons-worth-it",{"children":["__PAGE__",{},[["$L1",[["$","h2",null,{"children":"Introduction"}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":["I enjoy hackathons.

I can say without a doubt that in person is so much more fun. Although online hackathons are more accessible, I would much prefer to attend a local hackathon. When you're online, you don't make the same connection with your peers, especially if you don't know them beforehand. It makes the experience feel disconnected. Additionally, you don't make a good connection with the judges, especially when the submission is in video format. Half the fun is presenting to a judge right in front of you with the past 24 hours of work hanging in the balance of this 2 minute presentation. It's good practice for life in general, and I don't feel you get the same experience online. Online hackathons do have one big advantage, and that's capacity. They can have virtually infinite contestants from anywhere in the world.
